# notes
The notes in this repository are an extension of discussed of topics marked $\color{blue}(notes, WIP)$ in following repository:
<a href="https://github.com/sushmaakoju/research-experience/blob/main/learning-as-a-hobby/neurosymbolic-methods-study.md">https://tinyurl.com/neurosymbolic-methods-study</a>

Considering a large number of requests for some google drive folders/urls, I have chosen to "encrypt" my notes in a constructed language since this study is about language understanding.
The work-in-progress notes are going to be handwritten in a constructed language (yet to coin a name for the new constructed language).
However, these notes were translated to English as well. Please email sakoju2014@gmail.com for translated notes ie..e english version, once I mark these notes as complete.
Also because updating these type of stuff triggered some intense responses, therefore, updating this repository on Aug 4th and 5th 2025, I record the number of requests/folks that would go around attacking - by spreading false allegations and any form of IPV. 

Presently they are work-in-progress.
