# notes
Considering large number of requests for some notes/drive folders, I have chosen to "encrypt" my notes in a constructed language since this study is about language understanding.
The work-in-progress notes are handwritten in a constructed language (yet to coin a name for the new constructed language).
However, these notes were translated to English as well. Please email sakoju2014@gmail.com once mark these notes as complete.

Presently they are work-in-progress.
